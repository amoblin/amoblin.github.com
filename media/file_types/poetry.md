# Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
## by Jane Taylor, 1806

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br/>
How I wonder what you are!<br/>
Up above the world so high,<br/>
Like a diamond in the sky!<br/>

When the blazing sun is gone,<br/>
When he nothing shines upon,<br/>
Then you show your little light,<br/>
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br/>

Then the traveller in the dark,<br/>
Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br/>
He could not see which way to go,<br/>
If you did not twinkle so.<br/>

In the dark blue sky you keep,<br/>
And often through my curtains peep,<br/>
For you never shut your eye,<br/>
Till the sun is in the sky.<br/>

As your bright and tiny spark,<br/>
Lights the traveller in the dark,â€”<br/>
Though I know not what you are,<br/>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.<br/>
